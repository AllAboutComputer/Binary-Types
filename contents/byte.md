## Byte

- A [byte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte) is a unit of digital information that typically consists of eight bits. It is the smallest unit of storage in a computer and is used to represent a single character, such as a letter or number.

In machine code language, a byte can be represented by a sequence of bits. For example, the byte 01100001 would represent the letter "a" in the ASCII character set.
```
01100001  =>  a
```
- In this example, the byte 01100001 is made up of eight bits, each with a value of 0 or 1. The binary value of this byte represents the letter "a" in the ASCII character set.
