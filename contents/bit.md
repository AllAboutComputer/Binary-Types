## Bit

- A [bit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) is the smallest unit of data in a computer. It is a binary digit that can have a value of 0 or 1. In machine code, a bit is typically represented by a series of zeros and ones. Here is an example of a simple machine code program that sets a bit to 1:
```
   mov  #1, r1   ; Move the value 1 into register r1
   mov  r1, r2   ; Move the value in r1 into r2
```

- The first line of this code uses the mov instruction to move the value 1 into a register called r1. The second line uses the `mov` instruction again to move the value in `r1` into another register called `r2`. This sets the value of the bit in `r2` to 1.
